        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>15 ounces (425g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or basil for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente (firm to the bite). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> In a large skillet or saucepan, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once browned, remove any excess fat from the pan. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cheese mixture:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Sprinkle with a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with the remaining sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong> Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it rest:</strong> Allow the lasagna to cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Garnish the lasagna with fresh parsley or basil, if desired, and slice into portions. Serve warm and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
